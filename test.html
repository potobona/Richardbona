<p>Git (/ɡɪt/[7]) is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among
multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development,[8] but it can be used to keep track
of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed,[9] data integrity,[10] and
support for distributed, non-linear workflows.[11] Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux
kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[12] Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio
Hamano. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory
on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of
network access or a central server.[13] Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
version 2.</p>
